As they are deployed into telco clouds, containers and microservices will have to coexist with older virtualized network functions (VNFs), like EPC, SD-WAN, and security technologies that are running today.\n\nAntel, the leading mobile operator in Uruguay, is partnering with VMware to conduct a Proof of Concept (PoC) using VMware's Telco Cloud Platform for a use case-driven trial to gain operational efficiencies and deploy new network functions on the same Telco Cloud architecture from core to RAN to edge.

      "summary": "Topographic Target Light scattering - Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (ToTAL-DOAS) is a novel atmospheric monitoring technique to obtain atmospheric trace gas concentrations from scattered sunlight measurements. The main issue to successfully apply this method is the need of a telescope to identify the targets clearly and efficiently couple light in a spectrometer. Also the need of measurements with different logistic requirements (e.g. from different platforms as from mobile, airborne, vessels, etc) it is of benefit to develop a new optical system for data acquisition. There are two key aspects to take into account: One of them is the importance to preserve a constant temperature on the spectrometer's CCD. The second key aspect is to have a standalone unit which can be attached to different telescopes or to other optical devices in order to confront different experimental situations, and to be able to measure different optical parameters without the hassle of being concerned about the reliability of the spectrometer's condition. Specifically, the aim of our work was to build a standalone hermetic housing for an Ocean Optics 2000+ spectrometer with temperature stabilization and portability. In this paper a description of the DOAS-System is presented as well as the results of preliminary test measurements by monitoring the trace gases SO2 and NO2 measured at the city of Montevideo.",

      "summary": "We present a novel image contouring method based on the polarization features of the twisted-nematic liquid-crystal displays (TN-LCDs). TN-LCDs are manufactured to work between a crossed polarizer-analyzer pair. When the analyzer is at 45 deg (instead of 90 deg) with respect to the polarizer, one obtains an optically processed image with pronounced outlines (dark contours) at middle intensity, i.e., the borders between illuminated and dark areas are enhanced. The proposed method is quite robust and does not require precise alignment or coherent illumination. Since it does not involve numerical processing, it could be useful for contouring large images in real-time, which presents potential applications in medical and biological imaging. Validation experiments are presented.",

The satellite consists of a twounit (2U) Cubesat, which implies that the ADCS is designed under tight mass, size and energy constraints. For the attitude determination section, data available from sensors is taken as inputs for the computation of an optimal quaternion estimator. The use of an unscented Kalman filter is also discussed. The selection of hardware and algorithms is addressed. Though observing the system requirements and restrictions, the results display that it is possible to attain reasonable attitude estimation without the need for expensive sensor setups.",

Named for its fold-out cardboard viewer into which a smartphone is inserted, the platform was intended as a low-cost system to encourage interest and development in VR applications. Users can either build their own viewer from simple, low-cost components using specifications published by Google, or purchase a pre-manufactured one. To use the platform, users run Cardboard-compatible mobile apps on their phone, place it into the back of the viewer, and view content through the lenses.\n\nIn this project, research and tests were carried out on the possibilities of stereoscopic capture of scenes through the use of non-professional cameras. Various aspects of user perception were studied, optimizing the parameters of the stereo array of cameras as well as their configuration. \nOne of the main challenges is being able to minimize unwanted effects such as dizziness or user fatigue.\n \nThe project resulted in material that can be viewed both on the antelCardBoard and on televisions that support 3D technology. \n\nThe short videos produced include a CardBoard assembly tutorial, an adaptation of one of the science videos about the magnetic field, and two videos, one of them from the surroundings of the Telecommunications Tower and the other from the Mercado del Puerto.",

This research raises the possibility of making concrete contributions to reduce the operating and maintenance costs of gaseous emission and immission monitoring carried out by UTE in its thermal power plants, as well as applying flexible technologies in its facilities, in order to know through real data (not estimated) the impact areas of the plants. The development of this technology would mean for Uruguay an update in the most modern methods of atmospheric monitoring and keep pace with the technological advances that are being carried out in developed countries. The knowledge obtained may then be applied to industries that do not yet have fixed instruments to monitor their gaseous emissions continuously.\n\nAnother important aspect of this research is the possibility of validating the results obtained by both Institutions (UTE and Universidad de la Rep√∫blica) from the monitoring of chimneys by different methods.\nExpected results of the Project: \n1) Find technologies that facilitate and reduce costs and resource input compared to the current and future reality of UTE; \n2) Development of a national working group on the most modern atmospheric monitoring techniques. 3) National development of a technology of strategic value, capable of providing precise information on emissions to the atmosphere, useful when resolving national and international disputes; \n4) Development of a novel method that allows remote (kilometers away) and simultaneous monitoring of different polluting gases. \n5) Development of a method to measure emissions from different types of sources (fixed or mobile, extended or punctual), air quality in cities,\nroads etc. \n6) Training of human resources in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãatmospheric monitoring.",

      "summary": "This project is aimed at improving knowledge about polluting gaseous emissions and their impact areas at a local scale. The proposed project consists of the deepening and optimization of the \"Tomographic Target Light scattering - Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy\" method, recently formulated by the proponent. The method uses diffused solar radiation to obtain information from the lower layers of the atmosphere, thus avoiding the complications and high costs of using high-power lamps or lasers as light sources. A precursor of this system was developed in recent years in Germany and very recently, we have developed a new theory and a new optical system that allows other applications such as air quality measurements and pollution tomography through the use of \"targets\".\n\nThe method foresees the use of different types of ‚Äútargets‚Äù (e.g. ‚Äúblack‚Äù- or ‚Äúbright-targets‚Äù). In particular, we intend to study different elements present in the urban landscape that can be used as \"black bodies\". This study will be carried out in different atmospheric scenarios: different aerosol load, geometry and orientation with respect to the sun, humidity, etc. Among the \"targets\" to study are vegetation and other elements that may be \"black-targets\" in different regions of the spectrum. The method allows simultaneous measurement of various emissions such as NO2, SO2, formaldehyde, radicals, etc.\n\nAs a result of this project, it is intended to incorporate new technologies into the country and the training of human resources in remote sensing.",

The provision of electrical energy in a system of these characteristics is fundamental, a failure in the energy system necessarily results in the loss of the satellite. It is\nFor this reason, the reliability of the element to be placed in orbit is mainly defined by the ability to safely and efficiently manage the energy sources to be used by it.\nMotivated by this important aspect is that we focus on analyzing the problem of managing the energy of a nanosatellite with the aim of getting the most out of the investment of its commissioning.\norbit.",
